<h2><strong>* Server Upgrade *</strong></h2>
<p>If anybody experienced any issues in the late hours of December 17/18, I had to upgrade the host server.</p>
<p>The good news is this will increase the capacity of traffic for BestHomepageEver, and likely increase the load speed for you all.<br />I apologize if you experienced any temporary "blackouts". This upgrade was needed and long overdue. Now, your load success will once again be 99.99%.</p>
<p>Thanks and Happy Holidays to you all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="style2">September 25, 2014</span></p>
<p>10 Years later, so happy to be using BHE!</p>
<p>Thanks to you all.. A few updates that, of course, apply to you!<br />
200 New Pictures added to your homepage.. now over 1 million combinations of backgrounds/pics!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="style2">March 25, 2014</span></p>
<h2>MAJOR UPDATE</h2>
<h3>BestHomepageEver is now more mobile than ever!</h3>
<p>Take a look on your iPhone, iPad, or Android device(s). The links and appearance of the site will adjust automatically. I will have instructions on how to set BHE as your homepage on these devices in the next 48 hours. Additionally, you'll notice several graphic enhancements, with more to come.</p>
<p>If you see any oddities within the page, try to refresh your browser (clicking 'F5' is easiest). Otherwise, if you have an older browser, IE 8.0 or earlier, then it may be time to upgrade.</p>
<p>Also, new panoramic photos are being loaded all throughout the week.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="style2">January 11, 2014</span></p>

<p>Anyway, keep using, jumping to all the best sites in seconds!</p>
<p>Remember to Bookmark (CTRL+D -OR- CMD+D), or at least <a href="../set/sel-browser.html">add to your browser's tabs</a> for quick access.</p>

<p>BestHomepageEver has been completely re-coded from the ground up, now with mobile/tablet functionality. </p>
<p>Underneath the hood, I have cleaned up everything, so I hope you all can start seeing an improvement  on whatever Smartphone you use.<br />
  Essentially, all smartphones will have BestHomepageEver (Lite), with fewer links in the Best Of.. section
</p>
<p>And, if you use an iPhone, you can now quickly add BHE to your homescreen.</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/blogimages/iphone-1.png" width="175" height="255" /><img src="../pictures/blogimages/iphone-2.png" width="175" height="255" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style2">April 18, 2013</span></p>
<p>The BHE community continues to grow!! Thank you all!!</p>
<p>5 years = 3,500% growth (unique visits/month)</p>
<p><img src="../pictures/blogimages/bhe-stats-apr13a.png" width="787" height="343" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style2">April 4, 2013</span></p>
<p>I have been monitoring the homepage lately, courtesy of <a href="http://crazyegg.com">CrazyEgg.com</a>, to see which links are scarcely, if ever, used. As you can see, <br />
  as part of this update, I have removed a few links (categories are now to back to 2 rows long).  This should help you find and click what you need a bit easier.<br />
</p>
<p>I have also moved a few sites around and expanded the <span class="style9">News</span> section to give you some technology, business, and world news options.</p>
<p>Lastly, BestHomepageEver is now on Twitter!</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/besthomepagever"><img src="../pictures/twitter-long.png" width="142" height="27" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/besthomepagever">Follow me</a> to make site recommendations or link suggestions. Also, I will be announcing regular updates and asking for advice on Twitter as well.</p>
<p>That's it for now. As always, thanks for using BestHomepageEver!!!<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style2">April 1, 2013</span></p>
<p>Greetings all-</p>
<p>I am taking great strides in improving the homepage this month. Today, I have made it much easier and more attractive to set BHE as your (and visitors') homepage.<br />
  I have  further consolidated the page in length so that the Google button is now embedded into 
the search-bar automatically. <br />
Remember, if you wish to visit Google.com immediately, you can always  click &lt;Enter&gt; when BHE loads to jump directly to Google.com.</p>
<p>Secondly, thanks to you all who have voted BestHomepageEver as a <a href="http://www.the-top-tens.com/lists/best-homepages.asp">top-10  homepage</a>!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for some exciting new changes to be coming in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Justin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style2">August 15, 2012</span></p>
<p>Please read below for recent updates (Aug 12).. </p>
<p><strong>BestHomepageEver</strong>.com has now reached a milestone - 10,000,000 unique page loads*!</p>
<p>*since 2006, the first year data was recorded</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style2">August 12, 2012</span></p>
<p>I am happy to announce some new additions to the site. </p>
<p>First off, many people have been writing me from around the country and I can't say this enough - I really enjoy hearing from you all!<br />
Your suggestions, recommendations, praises, and comments have been constructive and meaningful, so I thank you so much for writing<br />
and I urge you to continue to write.
</p>
<p>On to some of the page enhancements...</p>
<p>First, I have expanded the shopping area with pop-up &quot;bubbles&quot; which will help keep the page clutter-free. You can now click on a general category<br />
such as &quot;Clothing/Apparel&quot; and you will be prompted with a bubble to choose which specific area of the category that you'd like. This addition makes it<br />
quick and easy to access more sites. More bubbles are on the way!
</p>
<p>Second, I've given Amazon a more prounced section of the shopping area because the links have been so very popular in the last 12 months.<br />
For all of those who like to shop from Amazon, hopefully this helps you out! Also, they are now helping BHE out by paying a small commission on<br />
purchases made from this site, so please click the Amazon link before your purchases to help me and the homepage operating.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have made some behind-the-scenes CSS improvements to make the page load quicker. <br />
This may not be noticeable to some, but every bit counts (no pun intended:).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style2">February 15, 2011</span></p>
<p>LOTS of new pictures and backgrounds added to the homepage today!<br />
Hopefully this will help you feel like the same picture or background doesn't come up repeatedly. <br />
</p>
<p>Look to see more textures, and, hopefully some of your own panoramic pictures!<br />
(thanks to those who uploaded them to me!)<br />
  <br />
By the way, here are the latest stats on BestHomepageEver. <br />
<br />
<img src="../pictures/blogimages/hit-count-jan11.png" width="645" height="270" /><br />
-- HITS  -- January 2008 to January 2011<br />
</p>
<p><span class="style2">January 25, 2011</span></p>
<p>I must apologize to my loyal homepage users, as I've been consumed by my latest project, my new personal business,<br />
  <a href="https://easyeta.com">EasyETA</a>. It's been an education experience to say the least! A lot of the time consumption and work is in the past,<br /> 
  and now I can 
  finally put a lot of my time and effort back in to Best Homepage Ever. <br />
  <br />
  To see my new project, OR if you plan on traveling to Australia, then you can obtain an <a href="https://easyeta.com">Australian Visa</a> through EasyETA.<br />
  <br />
  For those of you who uploaded pictures and ideas to me in the last few weeks, I thank you so much and promise I'll have<br />
  your pictures and ideas implemented into BHE in the coming weeks. <br />
  <br />
  Thanks and take care. <br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><br />
  <br />
  <br />
  June 25, 2010</span></p>
<p>In the last 18 days since my last update, I've continued to add new pictures and backgrounds. <br />
  <br />
  BHE is now displayed in over 3,000 different combinations of ways, each different everytime you<br />
  load or revert back to the page. This number of course will continue to climb.<br />
  <br />
  In other news, I've consolidated the computers and technology sections and repositioned newegg to <br />
the shopping category, where I think it belongs. <br />
  <br />
The new section that came out of that unused area is the new &quot;Deal of the Day&quot; or &quot;Daily Deals&quot; section,<br />
where you'll find websites that offer a single product on sale each day. Some of them will be local<br />
and some national, depending on which site you choose.<br />
  <br />
That's it for now.<br />
  <br />
Enjoy the summer everyone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="style2">June 7, 2010</span></p>
<p>Along with a new motto, today I'm proud to launch what so many of you were requesting and waiting for. <br />
  Now, every time you load up BestHomepageEver, both the background and front image change.<br /> 
  With 70+ pictures and 27 backgrounds loaded, there are over 2,000 combinations of looks for your homepage. <br />
    <br />
  Trust me, this is only the beginning. Rather than updating the page once a week, I'm simply going to add to the collection<br />
  of panoramic photos and backgrounds on a non-stop basis to give thousands of looks to the homepage over time. <br />
    <br />
  In addition to that,<br />
  I've fixed a couple of loose links. Most notably, new users can now easily set BestHomepageEver to be their homepage<br />
  by clicking on the link near the top-left (or <a href="#">here</a>). This is compatible with all browsers except Google Chrome.<br />
  (hopefully that will come in time).<br />
  <br />
  Lastly, the date and time listed in the far top-right of BHE, which is clickable by the way, will now automatically<br />
  remind you of national and worldwide holidays.<br />
  <br />
I hope you enjoy the improvements. More are on the way and if you have any suggestions or wish to report a<br />
bug, please email me. Thanks!<br />
<span class="style2"><br />

  <br />
  </span>2,000,000th hit on BHE today. Still in the minor leagues, but am very happy with the loyalty of people<br />
  who use this website as their homepage after all these years. Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br />
  ..........................Continue to spread the word!<br />
  <br />
  It was quite a bit faster reaching the second millionth click milestone (7 months, 2 weeks) compared to the first millionth, <br />
  which took 9 years!! <br />
  <br />
  I thank you all and do appreciate it! I still do NOT advertise and respect a good, simple homepage!<br />
  <br />
  For math people (including myself:), here is an updated 2 year chart of clicks per month (January 2008 - January 2010)<br />
  <br />
  <img src="../pictures/blogimages/mar2010_update.jpg" width="643" height="308" /><br />
</p>
<p>I remember looking at 12,181 hits per month and being shocked! hahhaha:) <br />
  <br />
  Take care everyone!<br />

  February 10, 2010<br />
  <br />
  </span>Well, today I've simplified the homepage even further:<br />
  <br />
  -- Removed StatCounter, which shows # of hits (although I am still keeping track')<br />
  -- Added <a href="#">Submit-a-Pic</a> page so anyone can upload pictures directly to me which will appear on BHE.<br />
  -- Added <a href="#">Submit-a-Link</a> page to take suggestions on improved links for the site.<br />
  -- Edited Travel Section<br />
  -- Added N.Y. and L.A. Times to replace MSN news<br />
  -- Edited Music,Food,Art section so you can search Lyrics as well as Bands.<br />
  <span class="style2"><br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  November 4, 2009<br />
  <br />
  </span>I've added several new links to &quot;The Bored Room&quot; which I think might occupy some time.<br />
  Some links are funny, some are random, but either way they're entertaining. <br />
  <br />
  My next project will be updating JustinCarver.com as it's been about 2 years since I've made any<br />
  major updates to the website. <br />
  <br />
  A quick note: I've constantly been receiving ideas and comments about BHE.. keep them coming!<br />
  I enjoy hearing from you all.. <br />
  <br />
  Tell your friends and family about the homepage!!<br />
  <br />
  Thanks,</p>
<p>Justin<span class="style2">  <br />

  <br />
  </span><strong>Important</strong>: I've removed Google as one of the top 3 links above the search bar, and replaced it with <span class="style9">Bing</span>.<br />
  This is for 2 reasons -- First, the search bar defaults to Google, and second....<br />
  <br />
  <span class="style9"><strong>You can always simply hit &lt;ENTER&gt; upon loading BestHomepageEver to load Google</strong></span>. <br />
  <br />
  Constantly improving! <br />
  <br /> 
  <span class="style2"><br />
  <br />
  <br />
  August 3rd, 2009<br />
  <br />
  </span>Well, it's been about a week already, but BHE reached the <span class="style9"><u>1 million</u></span> hit milestone!<br />
  <br />
  Very exciting indeed:) Well, actually it's just a number.. but I'm happy:)<br />
  <br />
  <strong>FYI</strong>: That counter began in April 2006,<br />
  .....6 years into the website's life <br />
  <br />
  (<a href="pictures/blogimages/page_loads_apr06-jul09.jpg" target="_self">Download Monthly Stats here</a>.)<br />
  <br />
  I also just wanted to write and thank all of those who have written me from around the country<br />
  with suggestions on links. Thanks to you guys, the site is constantly improving!<br />
  <br />
  Hope everyone is having a great summer!!!!<span class="style2">

  February 18, 2009</span></p>
<p>Thanks to a  good suggestion from a user, I've made a very slight, but highly effective change to the page.<br />
  Now, when you load up BestHomepageEver, <u>your cursor should default to the Google search box</u>. <br />
  <br />
This is particularly useful for searching the web immediately without using your mouse... and, on a side note, <br />
if you just hit ENTER when pulling up BHE, you are redirected to google.</p>
<p>Thanks to Scott for that. </p>
<p>Also, I've added a language translator link to the top right portion of the page. It may or may not stay there, <br />
  as the quicklinks section has traditionally been reserved for the most clicked links on the page, 
    <br />
  but many thanks to Don for the suggestion. 
I think a translation link of some sort is here to stay. </p>
<p>Have a great day and keep the ideas flowing! </p>
<p><br />  
  <br />  
  <span class="style2">September 29, 2008</span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style8">300,000 hits!</span> <br />
  <br />
  I never would have imagined when I created BestHomepageEver over 8 years ago <br />
  that people from 
  all around the world would one day be using the page and writing me about it.<br />
  <br />
  In the last couple of months, I've spoken to quite a few of you who are new to the page and <br />
  I welcome you!! <br />
  <br />
  Each week, each month, its popularity and community base grows to new records and I<br />
  thank you again for your continued support and word-of-mouth advertising! <br />
  <br />
  If any of you have suggestions for the homepage, please don't hesitate to write me with ideas,<br />
  link suggestions, etc. as I will do my best to make it suitable as your homepage along with the rest of us.<br />
  <br />
  When I used to have my email address posted on the page, I got spammed like crazy,<br />
  so if you just click on my name at the bottom, you can find my contact info on that page.<br />
  <br />
  This month, I've done some re-arranging to help give Wikipedia some more attention, seeing as <br />
  it's become one of the most widely-used pages on the Internet.<br />
  <br />
  Anyway, everybody take care and continue to enjoy the site! I can't thank you enough if you've<br />
  been helping spread the word!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><br />
  <br />
  May 19, 2008</span><br />
  <br />
  This month, I've made some major advancements for Best Homepage Ever. <br />
  First, I've completely removed the Quicklinks box, which stood front-and-center<br />
  on the page for about 6 years. <br />
  <br />
  I've replaced the box with what I think is even better - Simple pictures that link to<br />
  Maps, Directions, Weather, and a personal calendar (More to come?)<br />
  <br />
  By removing the quicklinks box, I've once again shortened the page dramatically,<br />
  which is a constant goal of mine to help you users see everything at once.<br />
  <br />
You may also notice I've removed the BLOG button and replaced it at the bottom<br />
with a simple link. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="style2">May 13, 2008</span><br />
<br />
Here are the latest numbers to demonstrate the continued growth of BestHomepageEver.<br />
April was the great month EVER and, with a record 5,000 hits in the first week of May, <br />
I have no doubt May will be even better. Thanks again!! <br />
<br />
<img src="../pictures/blogimages/may08update.JPG" width="653" height="315" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="style2">May 5, 2008</span><br />
  <br />
  I have added world news to the right part of the page, courtesy of BBC<br />
  and have updated a few of the main links at the bottom.<br />
  <br />
  Different games have been added, such as LOGD (which, for anybody who played LORD about 15 years ago would appreciate),<br />
  Lemonade Stand (courtesy of Kevin Smosky), and Tetris, courtesy of whoever invented that for Nintendo.<br />
  <br />
  Have a great '08 all!!<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
</p>
<p><span class="style2">April 1, 2008</span><br />
  <br />
It's been over a year since I've made a regular update to the blog page. I'll keep it simple!<br />
  <br />
  I've added a  link that I hope you all at least check out! <a href="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a>, which is a site<br />
  where you loan money to people in ANY amount which could potentially change<br />
  somebody's life directly... Just check out the site and donate if you can!
  $10, $50, whatever.<br />
  You get repaid, but the loan helps people start up a business in a 3rd world country!!
  <br />
  <br />
In short, a lot of the updates that I've made in the last year have been aesthetic.<br />
I've made improvements on the background from old patterned looks to more smooth<br />
and &quot;modern&quot; backdrops. I hope you've noticed:) <br />
<br />
Also, I've tried to keep the theme simple - EASY &amp; USEFUL!<br />
<br />
I'm happy to report that page hits are up 300% (March '08 hits vs. March '07 hits)<br />
and the site continues to
grow thanks to your loyalty!<br />
<br />
Have a great Spring and I promise it won't be another year before I make the next update!<br />
<br />
--Justin--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><span class="style2">March 3, 2007</span><br />
  <br />
  Welcome to the new year! I've consolidated the page as much as possible and,<br />
  for the most part, 
  have
  stuck with the same links within the main links section.<br />
  <br />
  The winter tradition for BHE has been a snow report, now found in the top right of the page.<br />
  This year, I found <a href="http://www.skireport.com">SkiReport.com</a> to be the best source for all mountains reports... <br />
  Besides that, you may see some snow on the page from time to time, simply for effects.<br />
  <br />
  Because I started receiving mass amounts of spam in my hotmail inbox, I had to remove <br />
  the feedback section. I can't handle the mass amounts of e-mail in my personal<br />
  inbox on a daily basis.. so thanks to whichever company started doing that!<br />
  <br />
  Anyway, I wish you all a great 2007. Happy Birthday to my Dad Al,who turned 60 on Feb.4,<br />
  and who's been a long time supporter of BestHomepageEver. <br />
  <br />
  Until next time...<br />
  <br />
  Justin 
  <br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2">December 4, 2006<br />
  <br />
  </span>Today I made an a whole slew of improvements to the homepage.<br />
  First, 
  the news/sports scores table was completely replaced with a more efficient<br />
  feed from two reputable sites - Yahoo &amp; CBS Sportsline. <br />
  <br />
  <span class="style2"><img src="../pictures/blogimages/dec06update.jpg" width="638" height="368" /><br />
  <br />
  </span>The finance feed offers up-to-date quotes on the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Composite, <br />
the price of Gold, and the price of Oil, as traded on the various exchanges.<br />
Plus, you can simply enter a ticker to get a quick quote.<br /> 
<br />
In addition, all major sports scores are now fed directly to the homepage and can<br />
easily be viewed by scrolling through the various tabs (NCAA football, NBA, etc.)<span class="style2"><br />
</span><br />
I also did some housekeeping once again in an attempt to further shrink the page so that it<br />
can be scrolled and accessed quicker. <br />
<br />
..Just another couple of reasons why BestHomepageEver continues<br /> 
to be the simplest,
most useful portal  for all of your Internet needs.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span class="style2"><br />
  October 19, 2006</span><br />
  <br />
  So, I've updated the Travel section with a few more useful links. <br />
  In addition, the live news section is up and running, even though it's still in <br />
  BETA mode at this point. My goal is to have more RSS live feeds on the<br />
  site by year-end. This would allow live stock quotes, news, scores, etc.
  <br />

  It's been a while since my last update due to the fact that I had computer<br />
  trouble. Luckily,
  everything is back and I'm ready to continue to improve<br />
  on the site's content and look.<br />
  <br />
  The next project, which should be complete by the end of the month,<br />
  is live RSS feeds. These feeds are what allow <br />
  <u>live streaming news and sports scores</u>!<br />
  So look for those in the very near future. <br />
  <br />  
  <br />
</p>
<p><span class="style2">June 7, 2006<br />
  <br /> 
  </span>I've learned how to design backgrounds for webpages! So here's the result.<br />
  Simple, colorful designs that are meant to make the homepage look its best.

  This week's work was done in the &quot;background&quot; of BHE. I manually went<br />
  through all the code, which isn't exactly a fun task by the way, <br />
  and shortened it. This will continue to allow quick load <br />
times and, for those of you who use Netscape as a browser, <br />
a better look. <br />
<br />
For those of you who don't write code, which is nearly everyone..:) , <br />
each browser, whether it be Firefox, Netscape, or I.E., each read<br />
code differently. So, it can be a bit of a headache trying to make sure<br />
all 3 read it correctly.<br />
<br />
Well, now they do. So enjoy now and thank me later.</p>

would like to see either changed or added to the site.The good news is that now that the site has been simplified with brand new coding,<br>
it's able to be updated and enhanced much easier and more efficiently. However, this is a test.<br>
<br>
My ultimate goal for BHE is usability. I will be incorporating some new and exciting changes to the site in the next few months,<br>

<p><font color="gray">I've consolidated the page quite a bit this month (about 35%), slowly phasing out the old &quot;Sites of the Month.&quot;<br>
I will be working on a way to make a list of <b>useful sites </b>in the future, but for now I think its best to have a smaller homepage.<br>
I've added an <u>encyclopedia</u> link to the Second Line so that we can all look up useful info on just about everything in just one click.</font></p>

<p><font color="gray">As mentioned in the frontpage news, the name "BestHomepageEver.com" will be phased out<br>
in the coming weeks and will be the official motto of the homepage instead. The actual transition will<br>
go unnoticed for many of you as it will be transferred to a different server over night.<br>
At that point, Besthomepageever.com will simply forward you to ThePerfectHomepage.com automatically.</font></p>

<p><font color="gray">I'm excited to start October. Progress is continuously being made<br>

which will be a portal to all kinds of multimedia, where people<br>
can pay a flat fee to have remote access 24/7.<br>

<font color=orange size=4><u>September 13, 2005</u></font>
<font face="book antiqua" color=silver>

<p><font color="gray">Over the last few days I've taught myself Dreamweaver, which is a software program to enhance the layout<br>
of webpages. In doing so, major improvements have been made to both the links section and the<br>
ergonomics of the page itself. Most notably, the page is smaller and more accessible.</font></p>

<p><font color="gray">Take notice of some of the following changes:</font></p>

<ul>
<li><font color="gray">You can now access your e-mail from the very top-left portion of the page.</font></li>
<li><font color="gray">The Links section containing sports has been moved to the new full-time sports section below.</font></li>
<li><font color="gray">The more commonly used, Internet Hotspots section, is now in the center of the page.</font></li>
<li><font color="gray">I added ticketmaster to the quicklinks section at the top, for all major sporting/music events.</font></li>
<li><font color="gray">My Personal Favorites section has been divided up, moving the links to their relevant categories.</font></li> 
<li><font color="gray">I've removed some of the more uncommonly used links, such as World Population and Google Groups. Sorry.</font></li>
<li><font color="gray">Lastly, various fonts and small color changes have been applied.</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="gray"><br>

<p>Some of these improvements have given me more ideas to work on. I still need a logo however.</p>

<font color=orange size=4><u>September 1, 2005</u></font>
<font face="book antiqua" color=silver>

<p><font color="gray">As I was gone for most of the month of August, my progress was limited. However, a server is currently<br>
being worked on to host the site. And, in addition, I've accumulated numerous unique backgrounds<br>
to be used for the next 6 months. Which, by the way, are some of the best to date.</font></p>
<p><font color="gray">The BestHomePageEver family of websites has also been expanded to incorporate<br>
5 other websites, re-directing into ONE, including:<br>

<p><font color="gray">I've entered into a partnership to take this website to the next level.<br>
By 2006, BHE will have its own dedicated server, increasing the speed and reliability<br>
of the site. I will also start advertising the site itself with my new motto:<br>
Besthomepageever - <font size=2><b>"THE PERFECT HOMEPAGE"</b></font><br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="gray">In addition, I am in the works of improving the overall appearance and feel of the page,<br>
all the while keeping it simple with the links that you want. No matter what, there will never<br> 
be any form of advertising - <u>no banners, no pop-ups, no advertisements</u>!</font></p>

<p><font color="gray">Wow, its been a year since I've even touched this page. However, the reason is that the news is now<br>
updated on the homepage itself and I've been able to fine-tune everything enough to where major<br>
updates aren't necessary.</font></P>
<p><font color="gray">One major update to speak of, however, is the community size of the homepage. The number of people<br>
using the homepage on a steady to regular basis has roughly doubled each year - now standing at over 30 people!<br>
Unfortunately, I don't know who you all are, but I'm glad you continue to visit!</font></p>
<p><font color="gray">Throughout the last 5 years, I've tried to stick to my original plan: <u>simplicity!</u><br>
Also, its important for me, at least, to have a homepage that loads fast and is easy to navigate.<br>
Anyway, I hope you continue to enjoy the website and I'll update again sometime in the future.<br>

<br>

<font color=orange size=4><u>October 22, 2003</u></font>

<p>
  <font color="gray">Quite a few updates this month. I'm still trying to improve on the new additions from September.<br>
First, the <u>Digital Artists & Photography</u> section has been removed and replaced by<br> 
a new section that will help un-clutter the rest of the page and add 3-5 more useful links.<br>
  </font></p>
<font color="gray">The following were the links listed in that section, if you were to ever want to download digital<br>
images in the future:</font><br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.webshots.com">Webshots</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.digitalblasphemy.com">Digital Blasphemy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.visualparadox.com">Visual Paradox</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.3dparadise.com">3D Paradise</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <font color="gray">All of these links were/are excellent sources for digital images, but were simply out-dated on this site.<br>
"Out with the old, in with the new" is what I like to say. I felt as though the links were somewhat<br>
dead and ready for an upgrade.</font></p>
<p><font color="gray">
A couple new links were added and moved, which I feel has improved the overall content of the page.<br>
In addition, a new background has been added, as well as a new picture from <b>Newberry Caldera in Oregon</b>.<br>
</font></p>
<p>
  <font color="gray"><u>For those who have cable modem broadband Internet access</u> and are looking to get rid of those<br>
  pesky "Messenger Service" pop-ups, here is a simple way to get rid of them permanently.<br>
Click <a href="http://www.pcreview.co.uk/article.php?threadid=3789">here</a> and follow the 3 simple instructions. It literally only takes 1 minute and it saves you the hassle of having to close out a
bunch of pop-ups everytime you sit down at your computer.<br />

  <br />
Lots of pictures will be available soon from Lake Powell, Las Vegas, and San Diego.<br>
I was shocked to see the "hosting results" page which reports statistics on the homepage.<br>
Here are a couple of highlights:
  </font></p>
<li><font face="book antiqua" color=silver><ul>
<li>36 Unique computers have accessed <u>BestHomePageEver</u></li>
<li>9,018 "Successful Server Requests" - or "Clicks" in the last 5 weeks. (257 clicks/day)</li>
<li><u>Tuesday</u> is the most popular day for usage; 2-3pm is the most popular time of day</li>
<li>September is on pace to be a much more popular month than August (about 1.4X as many clicks)</li>
<li>Lastly, I have estimated the actual # of people who use this site as their homepage to 20 +/- a few</li>
</ul>

<p><font face="book antiqua" color=silver>I'm constantly trying to make this website more useful for all of us who use it (7-9+ people or so). So if there's a website that you regularly visit that you'd like posted on here, I can easily find a place for it. Please e-mail me any requests that you have.</p>
<p>This week I've finally figured out how to post pictures on the site, so if you check out the pictures page, you'll find a few of the initial categories (trips & places) I've taken pictures. There will be more to come, as I have about 300 pictures that are probably worth posting - that I will eventually get to (assuming I have no limit on this server). Either way, I think it brings life to the site. If you use this homepage and you're reading this, eventually you'll find yourself in some of those pictures.</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy the improvements; and like I said, please feel free to e-mail me any requests or comments. carverjustin@hotmail.com - Thanks!</p>

<p><font face="book antiqua" color=silver>Second of two finalists for new background (2003). "Sandy-Black Marble" If you have an opinion on one of the two, e-mail me or tell me. I might actually introduce a third background as well. If not soon, then definitely for the 2004 changeover.</p>

March 15, 2003</font></u>
<p><font face="book antiqua" color=silver>Well, after about an hour of time spent looking for different backgrounds for the webpage, I came across two that I thought were very worthy of my "best homepage ever." The first which I call "green webs" is drastic, but extremely well done. The second is more settle, but also one of my favorites. This, will come in April.</p>
</font>
<p><font color="gray">As far as news goes, I completely wiped out the gaming links and replaced it with the most popular banks in the U.S. so that people can quickly link to their bank for any online transactions.</font></p>
<p><font color="gray">For any of you who currently don't bank online, this will be readily available and more accessible. I highly recommend online banking, as it saves a crap load of paper (I live in Eugene, after all. Recycling has become a part of my life..:) </font></p>
<p><font color="gray">No, just kidding, but everybody should at least recycle about 1/4 of the crap they consume, in my opinion. Well, hope all who use this homepage enjoy the new background. PLEASE!, e-mail me with your comments after I release the second background, as I will pick the more popular of the two.. <carverjustin@hotmail.com>. </font></p>

<p><font face="book antiqua" color=silver>Nothing major; although the Angels won the world series!! I guess that's major. I knew it!! Look below..:)</font></p>

October 11, 2002</u>
<p><font face="book antiqua" color=silver>Here you go, Kris. Finally made the update from over a year ago. 
The background is a bit different..., and I am looking for a new one to replace both. Go ducks tomorrow!
Big game against UCLA! Also, right now I'm sayin' that the Angels are going to win the world series..., so 
when I'm right in two weeks, my prediction was set in writing. Cool, well, hopefully everybody enjoys the changes..
some of which definitely needed it..:) ..J</font></p>
<u class="style2">July 9, 2001</u>
<p><font face="book antiqua" color=silver><font color="gray">I made a few new changes this month.. First off, and most obvious, I changed the background. If it grows on me, I'll keep it, otherwise I may change it back at the end of the summer. Anyway, I updated 'the links' and I strongly recommend checking out <u>Half.com</u>- Cheap prices on a lot of new and used products such as DVD's, VHS, CD's, and other miscellaneous stuff.</font></p>
<p><font color="gray">Other than that, hopefully you all will enjoy the summer. Oh, and also, Napster sucks now because they've been sued by several different companies and bands, so check out Aimster.com, which is a great replacement..! Not only can you pick up music, but other misc. files are available too.. Anyway, take it easy.. cya next month..jC</font></p>

<p><font face="book antiqua" color=gray>Two additions: New passport sign-in for MSN/Hotmail users, and a new background for the summer. Enjoy! More to come this summer</font></p>
<u class="style2"><br />
June 5, 2001</u>
<p><font face="book antiqua" color=gray><font color="gray">Got rid of the banner at the bottom until I can find something worthwhile
to replace it (Since Iexchange went under). I'm going to leave the investing page up, but it won't be updated often. 
(probably once a quarter).</font></p>
<p><font color="gray">Can't wait for the summer. It should be a fun one for many of us. Hopefully LBDAS will go on tour soon. Anyway, gotta go to bed now. -good night</font></p>

April 17, 2001</u>
<p><font face="book antiqua" color=gray><font color="gray">Today, I added the <u>investing page</u>. However, I'm only starting out with 3 stocks while we wait and hope
for a bull market. Hopefully, the Fed will once again lower interest rates, and the HK market will see
some improvements over the next month. Either way, the new page is up.</font></p>
<p><font color="gray">Throughout this and next week, I will be watching and tracking new stocks as well as trying to improve upon
this very simple page. Eventually, you will be able to click on the companies to see MSN graphs and charts, along
with short reports. But until then, let's just track $100,000 and see where the future of the economy leads us.</font></P>
<p><font color="gray">P.S. For those of you who have noticed, Iexchange has completely shut down. No more Iexchange</font></p>

<u class="style2">March 11, 2001</u>
<p>Changed a lot of out-of-date details on the page. Added new site of the month, fixed up that section,
and added <font color=orange>Movie listings</font> near the top... Plus, Andrew, I finally switched to <font color=yellow>PGAtour.com</font> to replace pga. 
I thought that might come in handy for Wallstreet. Also, check out <font color=orange>Upaya's</font> page linked in the music selection. 
That's about the only music update..</p>
<p>May be till late April for the next update. <font color=red>Spring Break!!</font></p> 

<u class="style2">February 6, 2001</u>
<p><font color="gray">Today I made the final touches on several aspects to the page.. As mentioned below, Wallstreetsports is new,
so I replaced a few links to help easily get news on sports. Also, weather is now available (see top-right hand corner
of page). I finally found a group of links I like (for February anyway).</font></p>
<p><font color="gray" size=3>Be sure to check out my <a href="http://www.iexchange.com/ii/sl?sidii=dmt8t1siqt.s22av&s=1048577&analyst=2Eh7aaqiFsVbb1zFr5amhS&area=Hacat2">Iexchange Portfolio</a>,

            <p>Quick update here: If you enjoy using this page, and are sick of advertisements from MSN and Yahoo, or like myself just want quick access to a lot of many useful sites, please take a minute to share this site with others. You can use the "Share with a Friend" tools at the bottom left, or simply tell them about it! Thanks for your support.</p>

            <p>With the addition of a couple more quick selectors for <strong>Media Streaming</strong> and <strong>Banking</strong>, I was able to further streamline the look of the bottom sections. To activate the quick selectors, just hover over the links.</p>

			<h4>Background Selection</h4>
            <p>You can now select your own background. Select the Customization Tools button <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></span> at the top right portion of the homepage to choose and save from 16 different backgrounds in 3 different varieties (48 different combinations).</p>
            <p>I plan on releasing more backgrounds in the near future.</p>
            <p>Also, if you prefer to keep the background rotation as your preference, you can easily choose to do so by hitting the "cycle automatically" button.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Cookies must be allowed or enabled in your browser settings.</p>
            <p><span class="text-danger">UPDATE:</span> I'm not sure that the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></span> button was very obvious to all, so I changed this to simply say <strong>backgrounds</strong>. This may be changed back when I add more customization options.</p>

            <h4>E-mail Quicklaunch</h4>

			<p>I have nearly finished "Phase I" of a long-term project to make BestHomepageEver more customized to your liking.</p><p>In 3-5 days, when you open up BestHomepageEver, you will be prompted with <i>"This website wants to know your location</i>." Agree to allow this.</p><p>By doing so, the first thing you'll notice is custom weather listed on the homepage, with more localized options coming soon.</p>
            <p>If you are concerned about your privacy, just know that I do not and will not ever track you. I am an individual, not a company. So, fear not, this is only to provide a customized homepage that will display local weather.</p>
            <p>You can also deny or not accept this prompt, and continue to use the homepage normally.</p>
            <p>More customization options will continue to roll out, and I'm excited for this initial launch and look forward to continuing to improve the page all throughout 2016.</p>
            <p>Thanks and enjoy! -Justin</p>

            <p>The days of 780x130 photographs are coming to a close. This is a good thing, as most of you, by now, have better monitors allowing for more wide-screen browsing.</p><p>I'm now at the homestretch of my project of collecting, cropping, sourcing, and uploading an all new batch of photographs to appear on your homepage. These will be about 35% larger and be in higher resolution, so hopefully you will enjoy! August 6 is the date I'm shooting for on finishing this project.</p>
            <p>I'm really hoping this helps the page pop, and is increasingly becoming more attractive as you begin your browsing experience.</p>
            <p>Have a great weekend!</p>
